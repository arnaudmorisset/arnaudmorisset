## Hi, I'm Arnaud Morisset. 👋

I am a software engineer with proven experiences building resilient, performant and fault-tolerant backend web services.
I've a keen interest on what happen on the server-side and I'm strongly DevOps oriented, spending quite a lot of time working on internal tooling.

I'm efficient with frontend work, but my heart can be found in the cloud. 😉

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working at [JobTeaser](https://jobteaser.com/), leading the Developer Experience team.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about OpenTelemetry.
- 💬 Ask me about web backend software engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter / Linkedin (links in bio).

**I'm currently open to new opportunities for a full remote positon.**

## What I can do for you:

### High-Performance Backend Development

Building performant and fault-tolerant backend services and APIs using Go/Ruby/Elixir and TypeScript, with proper monitoring using OpenTelemetry.

### CI/CD & Monitoring

With a _"You build it, you run it"_ attitude, I can handle the integration, deployment and monitoring of new and existing features.

### DevOps & Internal Tooling

I can enhance your internal libraries, custom tools and dashboards. I believe in an efficient feedback-loop and will update the developer's workflow toward that.

### Training & Mentoring

Despite being a programmer, I know how to write documentation and communicate with my coworkers (technical or not).
